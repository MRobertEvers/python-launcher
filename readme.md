## Virtual Environment

You can package a python virtual environment so the end users don't need to install python.

Follow this guide to install a virtualenv in the repo. [https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/venv.html]

Use the venv to install dependencies.

### Errors
If you encounter this error,

```
...
cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
...
```

Try using the following command in another powershell running as admin. 

```
powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
